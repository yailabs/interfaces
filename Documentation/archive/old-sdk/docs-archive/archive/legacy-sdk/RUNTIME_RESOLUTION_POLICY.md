# Runtime Resolution Policy

## Purpose

Defines canonical runtime/install/context path resolution for SDK consumers.

Canonical runtime ingress endpoint:
- `$HOME/.yai/run/control.sock`
- canonical override: `YAI_RUNTIME_INGRESS`
- compatibility alias: `YAI_RUNTIME_SOCK`

## Dependency distinction

Path resolution does not imply structural dependency on `law` repository layout.
If law-derived artifacts are needed, they must be consumed via explicit compatibility/export paths in tooling contexts.

## Preferred model

1. explicit caller override
2. environment override
3. resolver defaults
4. deterministic failure

## Legacy compatibility knobs

Legacy env knobs for direct law path resolution are compatibility-only and should be phased down.
